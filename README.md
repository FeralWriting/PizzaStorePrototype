# Pizza Store Prototype

## Overview

This is a prototype of a website for a pizza delivery service. This would be a website for customers to order pizzas, as well as managers and staff to receive those orders. This project is just a basic layout of the potential website and contains no backend to actually store and process information. All buttons that go between pages are functional and allow users to navigate the site easily. This was a project done for my Introduction to Software Engineering class. This project contains C# and gave me experience with Visual Studio and C# GUIs.

## Features

### Navigation Bar

There is a navigation bar at the top of all pages to allow users to navigate easily. The navigation bar contains buttons for home, cart, logging in or signing up, the menu, about us/customer service page, and settings.

### Home

This page would allow users to search for the closest store to them, and allows them to navigate to other pages.

### Menu

The page would allow customers to select what food they would like to order and add it to their cart.

### Cart

The page would allow customers to view their order and proceed with checking out.

### Log-in/Sign-up

This page would allow customers to create an account or log back into theirs. Accounts would allow their information to be saved for a faster order time.

### Card Information and Check Information

Both of these pages would allow customers to enter either their card information or check information to complete their purchase.

### Order Confirmation

This page informs customers that their order went through and how long it will take for the food to be ready.

### Customer Settings

This page would allow customers to change their saved information or delete their account. This is where they can allow or deny notifications from the store and access the pizza tracker, which would let them track their orders.

### Employee Settings

This page would allow staff to change their account information or delete their account. It would also give them access to staff and customer information, and it allows them to access the Orders in Queue page.

### Orders in Queue

This page allows employees to see which orders have been received and the status of said orders.

### About Us/Customer Service

This page allows customers to view a statement from the company and ratings from other customers.
